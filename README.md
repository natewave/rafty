# Rafty

A distributed key-value store based on the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io) and [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org) for storage.

:rotating_light: This is being done for demonstration/learning purposes, use at your own risk :rotating_light:

## Overview
The project makes use of the following tools:

* [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) for managing the components lifecycle
* [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org) as the storage layer
* API : [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) with jetty, [Reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) for the routing and [Malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli) for request/response coercion

## Architecture

![Rafty Architecture](rafty.png)
## Run

The project uses [lein](https://leiningen.org), so you'll need to have that installed in order to run the project

Before running the project, make sure to edit the configuration file to suit your needs in `resources/config.edn`

You can also set the configuration through environment variables

```bash
# The API server's port
export KVSTORE_PORT=3000

# Persistent storage location
export KVSTORE_STORAGE_DIR=/tmp/rocksdb 

# Peers addresses in the format: "id1@address1;id2@address2;..."
export KVSTORE_PEERS="2@http://localhost:3002;3@http://localhost:3003"

# The current server's id
export KVSTORE_ID=1
```

You can then start a node through lein

```
lein run -m kvstore.server resources/config.edn
```

## Scope of the current implementation

- [x] Leader election
- [x] Commands Log replication
- [x] Persistence
- [ ] Membership changes
- [ ] Simulated environment for testing, covering circumstances such as network loss, network partition, etc.
 
TODO:
- move the project to deps.edn
- add more tests
- ...
